Low-angle tracking shot: A modified Nissan 200SX drifts through a mountain descent at night, its wheels cutting through low-hanging clouds. Red warning lights catch the pearl white paint and tire smoke, while distant trains thread through mountain passes. Cinematic Japanese street racing aesthetic.
