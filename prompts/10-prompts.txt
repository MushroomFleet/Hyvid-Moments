we can use the project mapping @/project-mapping.json  to write a sequence of video prompts in reverse, by guessing what happened in the scene, we will adhere to instruction in the @/project-mapping.json  when speculating, writing a single video prompt at a time.
We will define the process methodology for this task in planning mode.

1. read the @/STORY/prompt10.txt and understand the context of the scene
2. understand the instructions in @/project-mapping.json 
3. write "prompt09.txt" which aims to explain how we reached @/STORY/prompt10.txt   
4. repeat the instruction for each page until you reach the "prompt0.txt" which will be the start of this sequence of prompts.
5. as you step through the prompts, with contextual awareness introduce elements to the story as you write each prompt.
6. each prompt should be a single paragraph
